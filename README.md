# AutoMudae Extension ðŸ‘¾
Automates the use of Mudae bot in Discord. This is the Chrome Extension version of the discontinued [AutoMudae userscript](https://github.com/Nxve/AutoMudae).

It is still in early development, thus unavailable in webstore.
You can expect it to be available for use after the completion of the below roadmap, _not including secondary plans_:

#### Roadmap to get it working:
- Notifications
    - Some of the events should trigger sound notifications
- Guild Config:
    - Option to get from `/server settings`
- Advise about it's requirements:
    - Maybe after installation, in a "guide" page
    - Requirements:
        - Custom avatar for each user
        - Slash commands only
        - /tu exposing every needed info

#### Secondary plans:
- Import char/series list
- Auto scroll to bottom of lists (Tokens, Characters, Series and Target users)
